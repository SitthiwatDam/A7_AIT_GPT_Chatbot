        "\n",
        "**Strengths:**\n",
        "- Successfully retrieved relevant details about admission requirements for international students.\n",
        "- Provided specific details when prompted for clarification (e.g., minimum TOEFL/IELTS scores).\n",
        "- Retrieved factual information for questions about the year AIT was founded.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weaknesses:**\n",
        "- May include redundant information within the response (e.g., duplicate points on English proficiency).\n",
        "- Might struggle with complex prompts requiring disambiguation (e.g., misinterpreting \"additional documents\" for admission).\n",
        "- May retrieve outdated information for non-data-provided questions (e.g., current AIT president).\n",
        "- Responses to open-ended questions could benefit from improved comprehensiveness and specificity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Unrelated Information\n",
        "The model occasionally provides information unrelated to the user's query, as seen in Error Analysis where it focused on visa photos instead of additional admission documents. And also the initial response for the non-data provided question regarding the current AIT president might be outdated. This highlights the limitations of the model in handling frequently changing information.\n",

        "The AIT-GPT model shows promise in retrieving factual information about AIT. Addressing the identified issues through prompt improvements, data augmentation, and ensuring access to current information can significantly enhance its accuracy and user experience."
